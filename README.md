## Problem Outline

In today's digital age, data generation is surpassing human comprehension. Can simple programming enable us to extract meaningful insights from TL;DR content?

## Data Source

This project involves web scraping and analysis of J. Robert Oppenheimer's Wikipedia page.
Page Link: [J. Robert Oppenheimer Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer#References)

## Approach

This project aims to achieve the following objectives for the TL;DR page:

1. Identify the main topics using a rule-based category function.
2. Extract keywords and topics from each paragraph.
3. Create a chart to visualize topic rankings.
4. Investigate the reason for the page's length by analyzing the number of referenced sources.
5. Compile a list of mentioned books.
6. Discover universities associated with Oppenheimer's life.
7. Apply sentiment analysis using transformer models on paragraphs.
8. Explore the techniques' limitations and features in web scraping.

## Outcome
