# Web Scraping Analysis Project

![Web Scraping](https://github.com/franco05hk/week4project/assets/71271948/974f2130-8c21-42e6-ac78-62af32b0c2c3)

## Problem Outline

In today's digital age, data generation is surpassing human comprehension. Can simple programming enable us to extract meaningful insights from TL;DR content?

## Key findings
1. Rule-based categorization faces challenges in capturing nuanced paragraph essence.
2. Topic count analysis efficacy hinges on rule-based system quality.
3. Science-oriented topics align with Oppenheimer's scientific prominence.
4. Extensive reference list poses "TL;DR" concerns, requiring manual refinement.
5. Sentiment analysis suits financial news analysis but not documentary writing.
6. The analysis underscores the interplay between automation and human intervention in extracting insights from complex content.


## Data Source

This project involves web scraping and analysis of J. Robert Oppenheimer's Wikipedia page.
Page Link: [J. Robert Oppenheimer Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer#References)

## Approach

This project aims to achieve the following objectives for the TL;DR page:

1. Identify the main topics using a rule-based category function.
2. Extract keywords and topics from each paragraph.
3. Create a chart to visualize topic rankings.
4. Investigate the reason for the page's length by analyzing the number of referenced sources.
5. Compile a list of mentioned books.
6. Discover universities associated with Oppenheimer's life.
7. Apply sentiment analysis using transformer models on paragraphs.
8. Explore the techniques' limitations and features in web scraping.

Q8ans:
1. Rule-based topic classifier is difficult to program and requires the programmer to have an overall understanding of the targeted writing.
2. Extraction for concise content can be hard to program, but using AI in sentiment analysis is useful for specific fields.
